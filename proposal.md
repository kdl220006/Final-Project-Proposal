# Final Project Proposal - "Bassline Crush - Visual Novel Game"

## Repository
<https://github.com/kdl220006/pfda_finalProjectProposal_LopezKendon.git>

## Description
A cute and silly visual novel dating sim with a Simon Says color-based minigame that determines your ending (Bad, Good, Perfect). It's relevant to digital arts and media as it not only incorporates 2D art-based graphics, but also is story-based entertainment media. 

## Features
- Feature 1: Character 'Romance' Option and Pronoun/Name Option
	- Create a list/dictionary to store romance options (only two), create a menu to display the choices, and save the selected option for story route/branch.
    - Prompt the player/user for a name using input() and then follow up with pronoun selection menu, store both of the selected choices in variables for use in character dialogue.
- Feature 2: Simon-Says Color Based Mini-Game 
	- Will use import random to generate a random sequence of colors, on the screen a sequence of colors will be shown (one by one). Player will be prompted to input the sequence using arrow/wasd keys.
- Feature N: Multiple/3 Endings, Bad, Good, or Perfect; based on ft. 2 score.
	- Based on the score of the Simon-Says Color Based Mini-Game, the points (0-5) will lead to different story outcomes/endings (Bad 0-2, Good 3-4, Perfecrt 5/All) executed using if, elif, and else functions.
    - Considering having a different triggered CG for each ending.

## Challenges
- How to include multiple pngs/graphic assets per page/screen.
- How to showcase the score on the screen for the user during the mini-game and trigger character or on-screen reactions to the user input. 
- Research how to trigger certain sprites/reactions for the romance character's during conversation.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A short but easy to navigate mini-visual novel game with well formatted graphics that is visually pleasing to the eye throughout the entire run.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Having at least 1-2 character sprites, with feature 1, 2, and 3 working. Minimum graphics saved for characters and the mini game, at least 4 endings with 2 per character.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Goal 1: Create story/script and conversations for visual novel characters, as well as all ending scripts.
  2. Goal 2: Start creating code WITHOUT graphics, add game function, as well as format script-triggering and endings.

- Week 2
  1. Goal 1: Finish base-code and research more on the graphics based features, start creating and sketching those graphics (as well as game) graphics and sprites.
  2. Goal 2: Start rendering grapic-character sprites, and game graphics as well. 

- Week N (Final)
  1. Goal 1: Implement graphics in code, create backgrounds and selection graphics and organize and format code well to not overwhelm myself and make it clean.
  2. Goal 2: Edit and test run, finish up 2D-art based graphics, made sure it's finished at least a day before due-date to leave space for errors or last minute edits.
